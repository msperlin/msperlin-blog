I'm the author of many R packages distributed in [CRAN](https://www.crantastic.org/authors/5303) (R repository of packages) and [Github](https://github.com/msperlin/). Most packages are related to importing and organizing financial and economic datasets from public sources. I fell that unrestricted access to organized datasets is one of the pillars of reproducible research, which is why I've taken so much interest in it over the years. 

If you used one of the packages in research, please use the proper citation format with `citation('pkgname')`.
