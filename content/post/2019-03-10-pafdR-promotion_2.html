<p>I received many messages regarding my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071DTSCPS">book promotion</a> (see <a href="https://www.msperlin.com/post/2019-03-09-pafdr-promotion/">previous post</a> ). I’ll use this post to answer the most frequent questions:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Does the paperback edition have a discount?</em></p>
<p>No. The price drop is only valid for the <strong>ebook edition</strong> but not by choice. Unfortunately, Amazon does not let me do <em>countdown promotions</em> for the <strong>paperback edition</strong>.</p>
<p>So, in favor of those, like myself, that like the smell of a fresh book page, I manually dropped the price of the paperback to 17.99 USD (it was 24.99 USD). Printings costs are heavy, which is why I can’t go all the way to a 50% discount. The system tells me that the new price should be live within the next 72 hours. I’ll keep the new price until the end of this week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>When will the second edition be released?</em></p>
<p>My schedule is to start to work on the new edition of <em>Processing and Analyzing..</em> on june 2019. Hopefully I can publish it before january 2020. Sorry but I can’t give much detail about the new content yet. But be sure I’ll keep you guys posted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Best.</p>
