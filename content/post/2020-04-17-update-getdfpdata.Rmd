After battling B3's website for days, I finally managed to gather a master table for all corporate data. I'm happy to report that the 2019's data is now included in GetDFPData, the CRAN package and [shiny interface](https://www.msperlin.com/shiny/GetDFPData/). This includes new financial statements and company's FRE data. 

I also want to use this update to formally thank everyone that made a donation in the [shiny website](https://www.msperlin.com/shiny/GetDFPData/). Your donation is not only helping paying for the bills of the server but increasing my motivation for working further in this project.  

As for R code with then new dataset, let's give it a try:

```{r, eval=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library(GetDFPData)
library(tidyverse)

name.companies <- c('PETRÃ“LEO BRASILEIRO  S.A.  - PETROBRAS')

first.date <- '2017-01-01'
last.date <- '2020-01-01'
inflation.index <- 'IPCA'

df.reports <- gdfpd.GetDFPData(name.companies = name.companies,
                               first.date = first.date,
                               last.date = last.date)

glimpse(df.reports)
```
