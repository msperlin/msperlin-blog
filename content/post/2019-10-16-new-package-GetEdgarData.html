<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>As of 2019-10-31, this package is discontinued and will not longer be updated. See <a href="https://www.msperlin.com/post/2019-11-01-new-package-simfinr/">this post</a> for more details about the alternative, package simfinR.</strong></p>
<p>Every company traded in the US stock market must report its quarterly and yearly documents to the SEC and the public in general. This includes its accounting statements (10-K, 10-K) and any other corporate event that is relevant to investors.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html">Edgar</a> is the interface where we can search for a company’s filling information. By looking up a company’s CIK code, one can find all previous filling information. A complete list of available forms can be found in this <a href="https://www.sec.gov/forms">link</a>.</p>
<p>Package <code>GetEdgarData</code> allows the user import the financial documents from such fillings directly into R. Unlike other packages, the information is not taken from the filling’s xml files, but the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/dera/data">structured datasets</a> at the DERA (Division of Economic and Risk Analysis) section . This means we can import a large amount of structured financial data very quickly. The downside is that the available data starts at 2009.</p>
<p>Like many other packages I’ve wrote for data grabbing, the queries are saved locally using package <code>memoise</code>. This means that the second time you ask for a particular year of data, the function will load a local copy, and will not download the data again.</p>
<p>Both new packages, <code>GetEdgarData</code> and <code>GetQuandlData</code> (<a href="https://www.msperlin.com/post/2019-10-01-new-package-getquandldata/">blog post</a>) are going to be part of the second edition of my book “Analyzing Financial Data with R” (see first edition <a href="https://www.msperlin.com/pafdR/">here</a>). My expectation is to publish the new book in early 2020.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<pre class="r"><code># not in CRAN yet (need to test it further)
#install.packages(&#39;GetEdgarData&#39;)

# from github
devtools::install_github(&#39;msperlin/GetEdgarData&#39;)</code></pre>
<div id="example-01---apples-quarterly-net-profit" class="section level3">
<h3>Example 01 - Apples Quarterly Net Profit</h3>
<p>The first step in using <code>GetEdgarData</code> is finding information about available companies:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(GetEdgarData)
library(tidyverse)

my_year &lt;- 2018
type_form &lt;- &#39;10-K&#39;

df_info &lt;- get_info_companies(years = my_year, 
                              type_data = &#39;yearly&#39;, 
                              type_form = type_form)

glimpse(df_info)</code></pre>
<p>We find information about <code>nrow(df_info)</code> companies for the <code>type_form</code> documents in the year of <code>my_year</code>. Digging deeper we find that the official name of Apple is ‘APPLE INC’. Let’s use it to download the financial information since 2009.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_company &lt;- &#39;APPLE INC&#39;
my_years &lt;- 2009:2018
type_data &lt;- &#39;quarterly&#39;

df_fin_reports &lt;- get_edgar_fin_data(companies = my_company,
                                     years = my_years,
                                     type_data = type_data)

glimpse(df_fin_reports)</code></pre>
<p>And now we filter for the net income (id tag = ‘NetIncomeLoss’) and plot the resulting dataframe:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>net_income &lt;- df_fin_reports %&gt;%
  filter(tag == &#39;NetIncomeLoss&#39;)

p &lt;- ggplot(net_income, 
            aes(x = ref_date, y = value_ref)) +
  geom_col() + 
  labs(title = &#39;APPLE Quarterly Net Income (10-Q)&#39;,
       subtitle = paste0(min(my_years), &#39; - &#39;, max(my_years)),
       x = &#39;&#39;,
       y = &#39;Net Income ($)&#39;,
       caption = paste0(&#39;Data from EDGAR &lt;https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html&gt;&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;,
                        &#39;Downloaded with package GetEdgarData&#39;) )

print(p)</code></pre>

<div id="example-02---quarterly-net-profit-of-many-companies" class="section level3">
<h3>Example 02 - Quarterly Net Profit of Many Companies</h3>
<p>The package is really handy for fetching information for many companies. This is due to the fact that the SEC/DERA stores data of all companies by year and the package creates a local cache of the resulting data. This means that, by fetching data for one company, we indirectly have information for all companies.</p>
<p>Let’s see an example by selecting four random companies and creating the same previous graph:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(5)
my_companies &lt;- sample(df_info$current_name, 4)
my_years &lt;- 2009:2018
type_data &lt;- &#39;quarterly&#39;

net_income &lt;- get_edgar_fin_data(companies = my_companies,
                                 years = my_years,
                                 type_data = type_data) %&gt;%
  filter(tag == &#39;NetIncomeLoss&#39;)

p &lt;- ggplot(net_income, 
            aes(x = ref_date, y = value_ref)) +
  geom_col() + facet_wrap(~current_name, scales = &#39;free&#39;) + 
  labs(title = &#39;Quarterly Net Income for Four Random companies&#39;,
       subtitle = paste0(min(my_years), &#39; - &#39;, max(my_years)),
       x = &#39;&#39;,
       y = &#39;Net Income ($)&#39;,
       caption = paste0(&#39;Data from EDGAR &lt;https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html&gt;&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;,
                        &#39;Downloaded in R with package GetEdgarData&#39;) )
