<p>Iâ€™m looking forward to attending R in Finance conference in Chicago, next friday (2017-05-09). The <a href="http://www.rinfinance.com/">program</a> looks great! I am really happy, and a bit surprised, to see so many presentations related to market microstructure in the conference.</p>
<p>I will talk about my package GetHFData in the first session. This is a package for downloading and aggregating trade data from Bovespa, the Brazilian exchange. More details are available in <a href="http://bibliotecadigital.fgv.br/ojs/index.php/rbfin/article/download/64587/65702">RBFIN</a>.</p>
<p>My slides are ready and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/6ici0cqowvd6fck/GetHFData-MSPERLIN-RFinance.pdf?dl=0">available</a>.</p>
