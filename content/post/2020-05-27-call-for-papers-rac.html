<p>Myself and Henrique Martins (PUC Rio) organized a call for papers on data reuse, for publication in <a href="https://rac.anpad.org.br/index.php/rac">RAC – Revista de Administração Contemporanea</a>. The deadline for submission is 10th october 2020, with expected publication date in july 2021.</p>
<p>We will select quality papers that use data already published and shared in other scientific outlet to test new theories or present a tutorial article, helping students see how an econometric result was achieved in practice.</p>
<p>You can find more details about this call for papers in this <a href="/files/CALL%20FOR%20PAPERS_RAC_2021_Data%20Reuse.pdf">pdf file</a>. I encourage everyone to submit their work. If you got any question, please let me know.</p>
