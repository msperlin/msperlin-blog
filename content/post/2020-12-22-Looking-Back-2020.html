<p>Wow, what a <strong>long</strong> year! The pandemic affected everyone, changing the way we live and relate to one another. This was a year full of lessons and we must be thankful and be able to appreciate life even more. Events such as these show how little our “problems” are when put into perspective.</p>
<p>I’m lucky that, despite the lockdown, I was able to work from home this year. Lets have a look at the highlights.</p>

<h2>Academic Papers</h2>
<p>This year I published and co-authored two academic papers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rac.anpad.org.br/index.php/rac/article/view/1420">A Garch Tutorial in R - RAC</a></li>
<li><a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1062940820301406">Does algorithmic trading harm liquidity? Evidence from Brazil - NAJEF</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I also worked towards my paper pipeline in corporate finance, with the following papers, which are currently under review:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial Performance and Academic Titles of Advisers and Directors of Brazilian Companies</li>
<li>Boards and Gender for Brazilian Listed Companies</li>
<li>Description of Boards in Brazil</li>
</ul>

<h2>Books</h2>
<p>The second edition of my R book - <a href="https://www.msperlin.com/publication/2020_book-afedr-en/">Analyzing Financial and Economic Data with R</a> was published in January 2020. I spend most of 2019 working towards this edition and I’m very pleased with the result. The book improved a lot, with a more polished content.</p>
<p>I’m also happy to report that my two other books, <a href="https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B07DN4M357">padfR</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B07RR9K9PV">pirf</a>, are receiving great reviews in Amazon.com.br. This is great news, motivating the future editions.</p>

<h2>R Packages</h2>
<p>This year I “broke” package <code>GetDFPData</code> into two: <code>GetDFPData2</code> and <code>GetFREData</code>. Both are still in <a href="https://github.com/msperlin">Github</a> but I’ll soon release it to CRAN. You can read more about this decision <a href="https://www.msperlin.com/post/2020-07-18-new_packages-getfredata-getdfpdata2/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, I also wrote the book package <code>afedR</code>, which facilitates the reproducibility of all book examples. See more details about it <a href="https://www.msperlin.com/post/2020-02-25-afedr-ed2-slides-available/">here</a>.</p>

<dd>Soon. The three papers are in revision.
</dd>
<dt>Publish paper about academic inbreeding</dt>
<dd>I’m writing a new paper about the effects of academic inbreeding in Brazil using Lattes data. The paper is its final internal review and will soon be sent to for its formal review. The results are very interesting and I hope to write more about it soon.
