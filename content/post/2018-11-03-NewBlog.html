<p>I while ago I <a href="https://www.msperlin.com/post/2017-12-13-serving-shiny-apps-internet/">wrote about purchasing my own webserver in digital ocean and hosting my shinny applications</a>. Last week I finally got some time to migrate my blog from <a href="https://msperlin.github.io/">Github</a> to my new domain, <a href="https://www.msperlin.com">www.msperlin.com</a>. While doing that, I also decided to change the technology behind making the blog, from Jekyll to Hugo. Here are my reasons.</p>
<p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is great for making simple static sites, specially with this <a href="https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/">template</a> from Dean Attali. It was easy to set it up and host it in <a href="https://msperlin.github.io/">Github</a>. My problems with this configuration are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>With Jekyll, all posts in the blog are created as .md files and not as original .Rmd. For every post with R code I had to compile the .Rmd file to .md and manually add figures and other files to the site directory. In Hugo, and using blogdown, I can compile it directly from Rmarkdown (.Rmd).</p></li>
<li><p>The Jekyll template in msperlin.github.io is very clean and simple. This is exactly what I needed at the time. Hugo’s template <a href="https://sourcethemes.com/academic/">academic</a> is specially made for academics and offers lots of new functionalities.</p></li>
<li><p>The github internet address doesn’t fell very profissional. I know this can personal opinion but a custom url tells me that the author has spend some time and money to set its webpage properly.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a lag between writing changes in files and seeing it live in msperlin.github.io. This can get annoying. With my own domain, all changes are instantaneous.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Hosting the static website in www.msperlin.com is very easy. I wrote a simple bash script that compiles the site locally using <code>blogdown::build_site()</code> and copy all files to my server with ssh. Going further, I also added documentation about my CRAN packages using <code>pkgdown</code>. See an example for PkgsFromFiles <a href="https://www.msperlin.com/docs/PkgsFromFiles/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I am very pleased with this setup and I hope that I won’t need to change it in the next couple of years. The transition is a lot of work! I had to recompile all Rmd posts and copy and paste all other textual content.</p>
<p>If you are a teacher or researcher, you <strong>really</strong> should look into <a href="https://sourcethemes.com/academic/">Hugo-Academic</a>. This is specially true if you use R, as you can integrate you Rmd files with blogdown.</p>
