<p>One of the subjects that I teach in my undergraduate finance class is the relationship between risk and expected returns. In short, the riskier the investment, more returns should be <strong>expected</strong> by the investor. It is not a difficult argument to make. All that you need to understand is to remember that people are not naive in financial markets. Whenever they make a big gamble, the rewards should also be large. Rational investors, on theory, would not invest in risky stocks that are likelly to yield low returns.</p>
<p>Going further, one the arguments I make to support this idea is looking at historical data. By assuming that expected returns is the average yearly return rate on a stock and the risk is the standard deviation of the same returns, we can check for a positive relationship by plotting the data in a scatter plot.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll show how you can do it easily in R using <code>BatchGetSymbols</code>, <code>GetBCBData</code> and <code>tidyverse</code>.</p>
<p>First, we will gather and organize all data sets. Here I’m using the stock components of Ibovespa, the Brazilian market index, and also CDI, a common risk free rate in Brazil. The next code will:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Import the data</li>
<li>organize it in the same structure (same columns)</li>
<li>bind it all together</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code># get stock data
library(tidyverse)
library(BatchGetSymbols)
library(GetBCBData)

<p>Now that we have the data, lets use <code>ggplot</code> to build our graph.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)

p &lt;- ggplot(tab.stocks, aes(x = sd.ret, y = mean.ret, group = ticker)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text(data = tab.stocks, aes(x = sd.ret, y = mean.ret, label = ticker), nudge_y = 0.03,
            check_overlap = TRUE, nudge_x = 0.05 ) + 
  geom_point(data = tab.CDI, aes(x = sd.ret, y = mean.ret, color = ticker), size =5) +
  geom_point(data = tab.mkt.idx, 
             aes(x = sd.ret, y = mean.ret, color = ticker), size =5) +
  labs(x = &#39;Risk (standard deviation)&#39;, y =&#39;Expected Returns (average)&#39;, 
       title = &#39;Mean X Variance map for B3&#39;,
       subtitle = paste0(nrow(tab.stocks), &#39; stocks, &#39;, lubridate::year(min(df.prices$ref.date)), 
                         &#39; - &#39;, lubridate::year(max(df.prices$ref.date)))) + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)

<p>Looks pretty! What do we learn?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Overall, most of the stocks did better than the risk free rate (CDI);</p></li>
<li><p>There is a positive relationship between risk and return. The higher the standard deviation (x-axis), the higher the mean of returns (y-axis). However, notice that it is not a perfect relationship. If we followed the mean-variance gospel, there are lots of opportunities of arbitrage. We would mostly invest in those stocks in the upper-left part of the plot;</p></li>
<li><p>Surprisingly, the market index, Ibovespa (^BVSP), is not well positioned in the graph. Since it is a diversified portfolio, I expected it to be closer to the frontier, around stock EQTL3.</p></li>
</ul>
