My paper about the penetration of predatory journals in Brazil, **Is predatory publishing a real threat? Evidence from a large database study**, just got [published in Scientometrics!](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-018-2750-6?wt_mc=Internal.Event.1.SEM.ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst). The working paper version is available in [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3067958).

This is a nice example of a data-intensive scientific work cycle, from gathering data to reporting results. Everything was done in R, using web scrapping algorithms, parallel processing, tidyverse packages and more. This was a special project for me, given its implications in science making in Brazil. It took me nearly one year to produce and execute the whole code. It is also a nice case of the capabilities of package ggplot2 in producing publication-ready figures. As a side output, our database of predatory journals is available as a [shiny app](http://www.msperlin.com/shiny/predatory/).

More details about the study itself is available in the paper. Our abstract is as follows: 

>  Using a database of potential, possible, or probable predatory scholarly open-access journals, the objective of this research is to study the penetration of predatory publications in the Brazilian academic system and the profile of authors in a cross-section empirical study. Based on a massive amount of publications from Brazilian researchers of all disciplines during the 2000â€“2015 period, we were able to analyze the extent of predatory publications using an econometric modeling. Descriptive statistics indicate that predatory publications represent a small overall proportion, but grew exponentially in the last 5 years. Departing from prior studies, our analysis shows that experienced researchers with a high number of non-indexed publications and PhD obtained locally are more likely to publish in predatory journals. Further analysis shows that once a journal regarded as predatory is listed in the local ranking system, the Qualis, it starts to receive more publications than non-predatory ones.
