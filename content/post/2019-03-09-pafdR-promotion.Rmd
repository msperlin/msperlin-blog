I recently did a book promotion for my [R book in portuguese](https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B07DN4M357) and it was a big sucess!

My english book is now being sold with the same promotion. You can purchase it with a 50% discount if you buy it on the 10th day of march.  See it [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071DTSCPS). The discount will be valid throughout the week, with daily price increases.

If you want to learn more about R and its use in Finance and Economics, this book is a great opportunity.

You can find more details about the book, including datasets, R code and all that good stuff [here](https://www.msperlin.com/publication/2017_book-pafdr-en/). An online and public version with the first 7 chapters is available in this [link](https://www.msperlin.com/pafdR/).

If you liked the work (or not), please provide a honest review at Amazon.com. As an author, I certainly apreciate it and will use the feedback for the next edition of the book. 

Best,
