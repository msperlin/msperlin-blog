<p>I’ve been researching financial data for over 10 years and gathered a great deal of compiled tables. Most of these comes from my R packages and have been used for creating class material, doing <a href="https://www.msperlin.com/publication/">research</a> and even <a href="https://www.msperlin.com/publication/2019_book-pirf/">writing a book</a>. These files were mostly found in many copies across different projects.</p>
<p>Last week I started to organize and centralize all my data files and noticed how valuable these tables could be for other researchers and teachers.</p>
<p>As of today, I’ll be hosting all public compiled data in my <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/msperlin">dataverse website</a>. Most of them are the product of using my R packages in a large scale data grabbing process. For example, I used package <code>BatchGetSymbols</code> to download daily prices of all stocks belonging to the SP500 since 2015 and saved it in a .csv file.</p>
<p>Hope you find these files as useful as they were to me. If you use it for writing a report, make sure to cite the package as the source of data (see the <em>Readme.txt</em> file in each folder for details).</p>
