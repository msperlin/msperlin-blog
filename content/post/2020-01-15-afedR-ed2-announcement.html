<p>After a couple of unexpected delays, I am very pleased to announce the publication of the second edition of my book, <strong>Analyzing Financial and Economic Data with R</strong>. You can find it in Amazon as an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084LSNXMN">ebook</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/171062731X">paperback</a>. An online version is available <a href="https://www.msperlin.com/afedR/">here</a>. More details, including supplementary material, are available in the <a href="https://www.msperlin.com/publication/2020_book-afedr-en/">book webpage</a>.</p>
<p>The first edition was released back in 2017 and it was a great journey working once again in this material. Many sections and chapters have been improved, along with new content. Here are the main changes:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Alignment with the tidyverse</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>Some base function are presented but priority is for <code>readr</code>, <code>ggplot2</code>, <code>dplyr</code>, <code>stringr</code>, <code>purrr</code> and so on.</li>

</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Teaching Material</dt>

<li>Rmarkdown slides for each chapter;</li>

</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Book package <code>afedR</code></dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>This package makes it easier to import book datasets, slides, functions and solutions for end-of-chapter exercises. Available in <a href="https://github.com/msperlin/afedR">GitHub</a> only.

<p>If you liked the material, please consider purchasing it and <strong>leaving your feedback at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084LSNXMN">Amazon</a></strong>. Your oppinion is very important for promoting the book and help others learn more about R and RStudio. As an author, I certainly appreciate the gesture and will take it as a motivating factor for future editions of the book.</p>
