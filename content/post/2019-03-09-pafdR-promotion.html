<p>I recently did a book promotion for my <a href="https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B07DN4M357">R book in portuguese</a> and it was a big sucess!</p>
<p>My english book is now being sold with the same promotion. You can purchase it with a 50% discount if you buy it on the 10th day of march. See it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071DTSCPS">here</a>. The discount will be valid throughout the week, with daily price increases.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about R and its use in Finance and Economics, this book is a great opportunity.</p>
<p>You can find more details about the book, including datasets, R code and all that good stuff <a href="https://www.msperlin.com/publication/2017_book-pafdr-en/">here</a>. An online and public version with the first 7 chapters is available in this <a href="https://www.msperlin.com/pafdR/">link</a>.</p>
<p>If you liked the work (or not), please provide a honest review at Amazon.com. As an author, I certainly apreciate it and will use the feedback for the next edition of the book.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
