<p>Another year has passed and now its time to discuss what happened in this cycle, along with future projects.</p>
<p>Year 2023 passed by very quickly, and I’m grateful for everything I’ve learned and experienced. Here are the highlights from my work.</p>

<h1>Highlights of 2023 and 2022</h1>
<div id="academic-papers" class="section level2">
<h2>Academic Papers</h2>
<p>I co-authored a single academic papers during this period:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://periodicos.fgv.br/rbfin/article/view/89040">What is the sustainable withdraw rate for Brazil?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, many papers are ready (or almost ready) for submission. I expect that 2024 will be a year with many publications.</p>
</div>
<div id="books" class="section level2">
<h2>Books</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I revised book <a href="https://msperlin.com/publication/2023_book-afedr-en/">Analyzing Financial and Economic Data with R</a> for its second edition. Most of the changes are in the background, with the use of Quarto technology for <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/books/">books</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote and published book <a href="https://msperlin.com/publication/2023_book-qrcp/">Questões de R em Concursos Públicos</a>, containing several questions about R used in public examinations in Brazil.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="r-packages" class="section level2">
<h2>R Packages</h2>
<p>Nothing special to report here, besides the usual maintainence of current packages.</p>

<h1>Checking previous plans</h1>
<p>At the end of 2022, my plans for 2023 <a href="https://msperlin.com/post/2022-12-29-looking-back-2022/">were</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Publish revision of <em>Analyzing Financial and Economic Data with R</em></dt>
<dd>
Done! The new edition is published in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Analyzing-Financial-Economic-Data-R/dp/171062731X">Amazon</a>
</dd>
<dt>Publish revision of <em>Análise de Dados Financeiros e Econômicos com o R</em></dt>
