Myself and Henrique Martins (PUC Rio) organized a call for papers on data reuse, for publication in [RAC -- Revista de Administração Contemporanea](https://rac.anpad.org.br/index.php/rac).  The deadline for submission is 10th october 2020, with expected publication date in july 2021.

We will select quality papers that use data already published and shared in other scientific outlet to test new theories or present a tutorial article, helping students see how an econometric result was achieved in practice. 

You can find more details about this call for papers in this [pdf file](/files/CALL FOR PAPERS_RAC_2021_Data Reuse.pdf). I encourage everyone to submit their work. If you got any question, please let me know.
