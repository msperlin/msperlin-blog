<p>Every end of year I write about what happened during the yearly cycle and what’s to come.</p>
<p>This year was very special and impactful for me. I learned a lot about myself, about what I do and why. Here are the highlights.</p>

<h2>Books</h2>
<ul>
<li>The first edition of book <a href="https://msperlin.com/vdr/">Visualização de Dados com o R</a> was published in October 2022. This was a great project and I had a great time and learned a lot doing it.</li>

I had a very good experience submitting it for publication in <a href="https://ropensci.org/">ropensci</a>. Both reviewers had great ideas that were implemented.</p>

<h1>Plans for 2023</h1>
<dl>
<dt>Publish revision of <em>Analyzing Financial and Economic Data with R</em></dt>
<dd>
I’m currently working on it. I’m implementing major changes in the background, on how the book is written and compiled. On a side note, it is great to have time to think about compiling books using Rmarkdown, and organizing it in a common framework. This will make it easier to update ALL books over time.
</dd>
<dt>Publish revision of <em>Análise de Dados Financeiros e Econômicos com o R</em></dt>
<dd>
Same as previous revision. Almost everything improved in the english version will also be done here.
</dd>
<dt>Write and publish paper about research schollarships</dt>
<dd>
This is is WIP (work in progress). I have no idea how it will turn out, but the main guideline is investigating the effects (or causes) of research schollarships (<em>Bolsas de Produtividade</em>) in Brazil. Final version and publication is likelly to happen in 2024.
