<p>Its been a while since I develop a CRAN package and this weekend I decided
to work on a idea I had some time ago. The result is package
<code>PkgsFromFiles</code>.</p>
<p>When working with different computers at home or work, one of the
problems I have is installing missing packages across different
computers. As an example, a script that works in my <strong>work computer</strong> may
not work in my <strong>home computer</strong>. This is specially annoying when I have a
fresh install of the operating system or R. In this case, I must
manually install all packages, case by case. Instead of focusing on the
script at hand, I spend considerable time finding and installing missing
packages. When using laptops for teaching R, many times I had to wait
for the installation of a package before continuing the class. With my
new package, PkgsFromFiles, I can scan any folder of my computer and
install all necessary packages <strong>before</strong> using them, as we will soon
learn.</p>
<p>One of the available solutions to this problem is to use package
<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pacman">pacman</a>. It includes
function <code>p_load</code> that will check if a package is available and, if not,
install it from CRAN. However, for me, I like using <code>library</code> and
<code>require</code> as it is consistent with my code format. Also, in a fresh R
install, I rather install all my required packages in a single run so
that I don’t have to wait later.</p>
<p>Package PkgsFromFiles solves this issue by finding and parsing all R
related files (.R, .Rmd, .Rnw) from a given folder. It finds all calls
to library() and require() and installs all packages that are not
available locally.</p>
<div id="installation" class="section level1">
<h1>Installation</h1>
<pre class="r"><code># from cran (soon!)
install.packages(&#39;PkgsFromFiles&#39;)

# from github
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages(&#39;devtools&#39;)
devtools::install_github(&#39;msperlin/PkgsFromFiles&#39;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="usage" class="section level1">
<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>The main function of the package is <code>pff_find_and_install_pkgs</code>, which will search and install missing packages from R files at a given directory. As an example, we’ll use my research folder from Dropbox. It contains all R scripts I have ever used in my research work. Let’s try it out:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Evaluation is disable so it passes CRAN CHECKS, but you should be able to run it in your computer
library(PkgsFromFiles)

# target folder
my.dir &lt;- &#39;~/Dropbox/01-Pesquisa/&#39;

df &lt;- pff_find_and_install_pkgs(folder.in = my.dir)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## Searching folder  ~/Dropbox/01-Pesquisa/
##  Found 74 files in 18 folders
##       R Scripts: 72 files
##       Rmarkdown files: 2 files
##       Sweave files: 0 files</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, function <code>pff_find_and_install_pkgs</code> will find all R related files recursively in the given folder. In this case, I have all packages locally so no installation was required. A summary in text is shown at the end of execution.</p>
<p>The output of the function is a dataframe with the details of the operation. Have a look:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dplyr::glimpse(df)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Rows: 41
## Columns: 3
## $ pkg            &lt;chr&gt; &quot;rvest&quot;, &quot;tidyverse&quot;, &quot;furrr&quot;, &quot;XML&quot;, &quot;fst&quot;, &quot;stringr&quot;…
## $ status.message &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Already installed&quot;, &quot;Already installed&quot;, &quot;Already ins…
## $ installation   &lt;lgl&gt; TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, …</code></pre>
<p>The package also includes function <code>pff_find_R_files_from_folder</code>, which will find all packages used in R related files from a given folder. It outputs a dataframe with several information about packages used in the found scripts.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df.files &lt;- pff_find_R_files_from_folder(folder.in = my.dir)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## Searching folder  ~/Dropbox/01-Pesquisa/
##  Found 74 files in 18 folders

<p>I also wrote a simple function for plotting the most used packages for a given folder:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># target folder
my.dir &lt;- &#39;~/Dropbox/01-Pesquisa/&#39;

# plot most used pkgs
p &lt;- pff_plot_summary_pkgs(folder.in = my.dir)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## Searching folder  ~/Dropbox/01-Pesquisa/
##  Found 74 files in 18 folders
##       R Scripts: 72 files
##       Rmarkdown files: 2 files
##       Sweave files: 0 files</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>print(p)</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I’m a big fan of the <code>tidyverse</code>!</p>
<p>Hope you guys find the package useful! Fell free to send any question to the comment section of the post or my email (<a href="mailto:marceloperlin@gmail.com" class="email">marceloperlin@gmail.com</a>).</p>
