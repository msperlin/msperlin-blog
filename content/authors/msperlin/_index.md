<div class="alert alert-danger">
  I recently published the revised second edition of my R book "Analyzing Financial and Economic Data with R". See this <a href = "https://www.msperlin.com/blog/post/2021-02-28-afedr-revision-2021/">blog post</a> for more details.

I'm an associate professor of Finance at Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), south of Brazil. Details about my past and current work are available in section [Publications](/blog/publication) and [Code](/blog/code). My CV is available as [pdf](/blog/files/cv.pdf) and [Lattes link](http://lattes.cnpq.br/3262699324398819). 

In this blog I will write about my CRAN packages and any other ideas about finance and R or research papers that I’m currently working on. The content, however, will be mostly about R.

Got a question? Fell free to reach me at [marceloperlin@gmail.com](mailto:marceloperlin@gmail.com).
